            1. Demonstrate and communicate aesthetic skills and choices based on traditional art theory, current game development 
            practices and next-generation research.
            <br>
            <br>
            2. Conceptualize and generate pre-production art assets through pre-visualization and prototypes usable for multiple game 
            platforms.
            <br>
            <br>
            3. Demonstrate a cross-section of baseline skills needed to create 2D and 3D art, textures and animation assets utilizing 
            industry-standard software tools. 
            <br>
            <br>
            4. Demonstrate the ability to build industry-quality game assets specializing in specific 2D and/or 3D art and/or animations 
            utilizing industry-standard software tools, pipelines and platform guidelines.
            <br>
            <br>
            5. Adapt, export, integrate, and optimize game art and animation assets (including shaders and lighting) into 2D and 3D 
            game projects working within a production pipeline and the confines of a project's game engine, tools and other 
            constraints. 
            <br>
            <br>
            6. Establish collaboration, mentorship and professional leadership skills by working with other disciplines to deliver highly
